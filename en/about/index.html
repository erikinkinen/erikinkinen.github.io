My work in Droidian and Cutie Shell Project includes team work with other contributors.</p><p>I have experience in DevOps methodology which emphasizes intergration and automation of various softare development and delivery processes. Both Droidian and Cutie Shell Project merge patches to the main branch as soon as possible. Larger feature additions are initially developed on feature branches. However, all work-in-progress feature branches are rebased to the main branch often, so that merging these branches could be done at any point. Both the main branch and the feature branches are built and packaged after every commit. Alongside the production repository, there are the staging repository and feature repositories corresponding to each feature branch. These package repositories are used to easily automate creating of a testing environment.</p><p>I am also interested in natural languages and learning them. Consequently, I speak several languages.</p><h2 id=projects>Projects<a href=#projects class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p><strong>Droidian GNU/Linux</strong> : 3/2021-<br><a href=https://droidian.org/>https://droidian.org/</a> / <a href=https://github.com/droidian/>https://github.com/droidian/</a></p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Droidian is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian for mobile devices.
