## Projects

In addition to my studies, I do a lot of open source project development in my spare time.

Currently, I am an active developer of [Cutie Shell Project](https://cutie-shell.org) and I am also a team member of [Droidian GNU/Linux](https://droidian.org). You can watch me presenting Droidian on a live stream linked below.

I have also contributed to [GNOME Music Player](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Music)

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/erikinkinen) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/erikinkinen).
